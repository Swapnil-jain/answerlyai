Order of doing things:
6. Remove the rupee dollar conversion thing in footer.
12. Prevent navigation from dashboard without saving email changes.
14. Actually make sure respective tiers have upper limits for chatbots, embedding limits.
15. Next billing date bug.
12. Handle the cases where word limit gets over. 1.90$ = 100,000 extra words?

In later version:
1. Add paypal as alternative payment method.
2. Try to remove 'use client' directive wherever possible
1. Change models if needed for highest tier.
2. Firewalls for the VPS
3. Make the chatbot multilingual. Ask what language the user wants to use in widget for the greeting.
6. Referral system for companies.
7. Integration with websites, messaging apps (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger).
   - Some sort of handoff mechanism for real human when human fails.
8. Pre-designed templates for common industries (e.g., e-commerce, SaaS, healthcare).
10. Provide some sort of solution for customers to hire me if they want to integrate the chatbot with their backend.
11. Add discord
14. 'Total Conversations' in dashboard show be separated into 2 parts (maybe)
15. Downloadable dashboard reports in CSV/PDF.
16. Make the chat history persist for the answerlyAI main chatbot.
17. Further optimise db calls if possible.
18. Add some sort of interactive tutorial for first time users.
20. Work on SEO optimisation.
21. Fix the bug that entering long text in decision node causes it to spill out.
22. A dark mode?
23. Changes in website are automatically reflected in the chatbot.
27. Somehow find a way to integrate the chatbot with the backend:
    - Dynamic updates: AI keeps the bot's knowledge up-to-date when changes are made to the database.
    - I will add a pre-trained bot with a database ready so customers can try things on that.
28. Some sort of rolling carousel showing all brands I have worked with.
29. Options for quick customization of greeting messages, colours, tone in the widget area.
30. Use CDN for latest content.

Things to do in prod:
1. Delete useless columns from supabase rate_limit/user_tier tables.
2. Correct webhook link in dodopayments.
3. Live dodopayments link enabled.
4. Correct product IDs for live payments (different from .env.local)
5. Correct URLs.
6. npx playwright install MIGHT need to be run, check first if web crawler is working.
7. Top up credits in deepinfra.
8. Update the answerlyAI main chatbot with latest data.
