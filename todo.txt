Order of doing things:
1. Fix bugs if any.
2. Add welcome emails for new users.
3. Work on SEO optimisation.
  - Add subdomain for blog posts.
  - Add Backlinks
  - Fix all bugs reported by google console

In later version:
1. A new demo and intro video.
2. Referral system for companies.
3. Integration with websites, messaging apps (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram).
4. Add paypal as alternative payment method.
6. Try to remove 'use client' directive wherever possible
7. Implement appropriate RLS policies in supabase.
8. Refresh work limit if someone upgrades to a higher tier.
9. Handle the cases where word limit gets over. 1.90$ = 100,000 extra words?
  - Might need some sort of carryforward mechanism.
11. Enforce that the respective tiers have different analytics and customisations.
12. Prevent navigation from dashboard without saving email changes.


Lot later version:
22. A dark mode.
4. Change models if needed for highest tier.
6. Make the chatbot/website multilingual. Ask what language the user wants to use in widget for the greeting.
9. Pre-designed templates for common industries (e.g., e-commerce, SaaS, healthcare).
14. 'Total Conversations' in dashboard show be separated into 2 parts: widget and workfloweditor area chatbot (maybe)
15. Downloadable dashboard reports in CSV/PDF.
16. Make the chat history persist for the answerlyAI main chatbot if possible.
17. Further optimise db calls if possible.
18. Add some sort of interactive tutorial for first time users.
21. Fix the bug that entering long text in decision node causes it to spill out.
27. Somehow find a way to integrate the chatbot with the backend (might be discarded):
    - Dynamic updates: AI keeps the bot's knowledge up-to-date when changes are made to the database.
    - I will add a pre-trained bot with a database ready so customers can try things on that.
    - Some sort of solution for customers to hire me if they want to integrate the chatbot with their backend.
28. Some sort of rolling carousel showing all brands I have worked with.
30. Use CDN for latest content.
31. Buy a professional email for answerlyAI.
32. Some sort of handoff mechanism for real human when human fails.
33. Ability to upload PDF files and extract information from them to train the chatbot.
34. Transition from pattern matching/rule-based categorisation to semantic/RAG approach.


Things to do in prod:
1. Delete useless columns from supabase rate_limit/user_tier tables.
2. Correct webhook link in dodopayments.
3. Live dodopayments link enabled.
4. Correct product IDs for live payments (different from .env.local)
5. Correct URLs.
6. npx playwright install MIGHT need to be run, check first if web crawler is working.
7. Top up credits in deepinfra.
8. Update the answerlyAI main chatbot with latest data.
9. Remove the rupee dollar conversion thing in footer.
10. Test if the domain restriction is working as expected.
11. Demote all current hobbyist users to free tier.
